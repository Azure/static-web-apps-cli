## What is Static Web Apps?

Azure Static Web Apps is a turnkey service for modern full-stack applications with pre-built or pre-rendered front-ends, and serverless backends. It became [generally available in May 2021](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-static-web-apps-is-now-generally-available/?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall) and:

 * works with [your favorite front-end frameworks and static site generators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks) 
 * has [quickstart options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript) for IDE, command line, and browser (via Azure Portal).
 * can automate workflows for code repositories in [GitHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript), [GitLab](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/gitlab?tabs=vanilla-javascript) and [Bit Bucket](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/bitbucket?tabs=vanilla-javascript).

## What is SWA CLI?

The Static Web Apps CLI (aka **SWA CLI**) is an [open-source](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli) command-line tool to support local development for [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps). Using the SWA CLI, you can:

- Serve static app assets, or proxy to your app dev server
- Serve¬†API requests, or proxy to APIs running in Azure Functions Core Tools
- Emulate authentication and authorization (with mock responses)
- Emulate Static Web Apps configuration (including routing & role-based auth)
- Deploy your app to Azure Static Web Apps (for a unified develop-deploy workflow)


## SWA CLI Components

At a high level, the architecture looks something like this:

![Static Web Apps CLI Architecture](../static/img/swa-cli-arch.png)

The key components of the SWA CLI are:

- A **Reverse Proxy**. The heart of the CLI. It forwards HTTP requests to the appropriate components:
  - `/.auth/**` requests are forwarded to the Auth emulator server.
  - `/api/**` requests are forwarded to the localhost API function (if available).
  - `/**` all other requests are forwarded to the static assets server (serving the front-end app).
- The **Auth emulator server**. Emulates auth flow, returning mock responses.
- The **Static content server**. Serves app's static content locally for testing, validation.
- The **Serverless API server**. Served by Azure Functions Core Tools, for local API testing.

>  **```üö® CAVEAT: STATIC WEB APPS CLI IS CURRENTLY IN PREVIEW. üö®```** <br/> It _emulates_ key capabilities of the Azure Static Web Apps service, so differences from actual behavior are to be expected. Deploy and test your app in Azure for final validation.


## Contribute to SWA CLI

Static Web Apps CLI preview release v0.8.3 was releaseed in **April 2022**. The v1.0 release is expected to launch in **May 2022** with enhanced commands and features.
