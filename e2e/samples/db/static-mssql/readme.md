Use this repo with the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript) to build and customize a new static site.

This means if you open it inside a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or using [VS Code with the remote containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), it will be opened inside a container with all the dependencies already installed.
