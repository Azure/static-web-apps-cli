- Fix language bar truncating languages that overflow screen width
- Strip HTML tags from ToC title before displaying it in title bar in JS (backup to stripping done in Ruby code) (thanks @atic)

To enable the new clipboard icon, you need to add `code_clipboard: true` to the frontmatter of source/index.html.md.
