The Static Web Apps CLI, also known as SWA CLI, serves as a local development tool for [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps). It can:

- Serve static app assets, or proxy to your app dev server
- Serve API requests, or proxy to APIs running in Azure Functions Core Tools
- Emulate authentication and authorization
- Emulate Static Web Apps configuration, including routing and ACL roles
- Deploy your app to Azure Static Web Apps

## Important Notes

**Static Web Apps CLI is in preview.** If you have suggestions or you encounter issues, please report them or help us fix them. Your contributions are very much appreciated. 🙏

The CLI emulates commonly used capabilities of the Azure Static Web Apps cloud service. **Some differences are expected. Always deploy and test your apps in Azure to confirm behavior.**

## Quickstart

> Note: This quickstart assumes you are serving a front-end app from the curent folder. For more advanced use cases, see below.

### Using `npm` or `yarn`:

- Install the cli

  ```bash
  npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli
  ```

  > Note: The CLI can also be installed locally as a devDependency: `npm install -D @azure/static-web-apps-cli`. This is highly recommended.

- Open a SWA app folder at the root (outside any /api or /app folders):
  ```bash
  cd my-awesome-swa-app
  ```
- Start the emulator:
  ```bash
  swa start
  ```
- Access your SWA app from `http://localhost:4280`

### Using `npx`:

- Open a SWA app folder at the root (outside any /api or /app folders):

```bash
cd my-awesome-swa-app
```

- Start the emulator:

```bash
npx @azure/static-web-apps-cli start
```

- Access your SWA app from `http://localhost:4280`

## Start the emulator

### Serve from a folder

By default, the CLI starts and serves any the static content from the current working directory `./`:

```bash
swa start
```

However, you can override this behavior. If the artifact folder of your static app is under a different folder (e.g. `./my-dist`), then run the CLI and provide that folder:

```bash
swa start ./my-dist
```

### Serve from a dev server

When developing your front-end app locally, it's often useful to use the dev server that comes with your front-end framework's CLI to serve your app content. Using the framework CLI allows you to use built-in features like the livereload and HMR (hot module replacement).

To use SWA CLI with your local dev server, follow these two steps:

1. Start your local dev server (as usual). For example, if you are using Angular: `ng serve` (or `npm start`)
1. In a separate terminal, run `swa start` with the URI provided by the dev server, in the following format:

```bash
swa start http://<APP_DEV_SERVER_HOST>:<APP_DEV_SERVER_PORT>
```

Here is a list of the default ports used by some popular dev servers:

| Tool                                                                               | Port | Command                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| [Angular](https://angular.io/cli)                                                  | 4200 | `swa start http://localhost:4200` |
| [Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)     | 5000 | `swa start http://localhost:5000` |
| [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-cli/)                                | 8000 | `swa start http://localhost:8000` |
| [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/)                                    | 1313 | `swa start http://localhost:1313` |
| [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)                                                     | 3000 | `swa start http://localhost:3000` |
| [React (Create React App)](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)   | 3000 | `swa start http://localhost:3000` |
| [Svelte (sirv-cli)](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli/) | 5000 | `swa start http://localhost:5000` |
| [Vue](https://cli.vuejs.org/)                                                      | 8080 | `swa start http://localhost:8080` |

Instead of starting a dev server separately, you can provide the startup command to the CLI.

```bash
# npm start script (React)
swa start http://localhost:3000 --run "npm start"

# dotnet watch (Blazor)
swa start http://localhost:5000 --run "dotnet watch run"

# Jekyll
swa start http://localhost:4000 --run "jekyll serve"

# custom script
swa start http://localhost:4200 --run "./startup.sh"
```

Then access the application with the emulated services from `http://localhost:4280`

### Serve both the front-end app and API

If your project includes API functions, the CLI will check if the Azure Functions Core Tools are installed and available. If not, the CLI will download and install the right version of the Azure Functions Core Tools.

#### Start the API server automatically

Run the CLI and provide the folder that contains the API backend (a valid Azure Functions App project):

```bash
# static content plus an API
swa start ./my-dist --api-location ./api

# front-end dev server plus an API
swa start http://localhost:3000 --api-location ./api
```

#### Start API server manually

When developing your backend locally, sometimes it's useful to run Azure Functions Core Tools separately to serve your API. This allows you to use built-in features like debugging and rich editor support.

To use the CLI with your local API backend dev server, follow these two steps:

1. Start your API using Azure Functions Core Tools: `func host start` or start debugging in VS Code.
2. In a separate terminal, run the SWA CLI with the `--api-location` flag and the URI of the local API server, in the following format:

```bash
swa start ./my-dist --api-location http://localhost:7071
```

## Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps

The CLI can also be used to deploy an app to Azure Static Web Apps using the command: `swa deploy`. A **Deployment Token** is required in order to make a deployment. You can access your Deployment Token by following the instructions.

### Deployment token

A deployment token is required to deploy to Azure Static Web Apps. You can get a token from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/): **Home → Static Web App → Your Instance → Overview → Manage deployment token**

If you are using the [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/azcli), you can get the deployment token of your project using the following command:

```bash
az staticwebapp secrets list --name <application-name> --query "properties.apiKey"
```

You can then use that value with the `--deployment-token <token>`, or you can create an environment variable called `SWA_CLI_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` and set it to the deployment token.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't store the deployment token in a public repository. It should be kept secret!

### Deploying a front-end app to Azure Static Web Apps

You can deploy a front-end application (without an API) from the current folder to Azure Static Web Apps by running the following steps:

1. If your front-end application requires a build step, run the build step (e.g. `npm run build`) or refer to your application build instructions.

2. From the application build folder, run the deploy command:

```bash
swa deploy --deployment-token <token>
```

> Note: the current folder must contain the static content of your app to be deployed!

You can also deploy the front-end application from a specific folder by providing the `--output-location` option:

1. If your front-end application requires a build step, run the build step (e.g. `npm run build`) or refer to your application build instructions.

2. Deploy your app:

```bash
swa deploy --output-location ./my-dist --deployment-token <token>
```

### Deploying a front-end app and an API to Azure Static Web Apps

To deploy both the front-end app and an API to Azure Static Web Apps, use the following command:

1. If your front-end application requires a build step, run the build step (e.g. `npm run build`) or refer to your application build instructions.

2. Deploy your app:

```bash
swa deploy --output-location ./my-dist --api-location ./api --deployment-token <token>
```

### Deploy using the swa-cli.config.json

If you are using a [`swa-cli.config.json`](#swa-cli.config.json) configuration file in your project and have a single configuration entry, for example:

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "app": {
      "appLocation": "./",
      "context": "./",
      "outputLocation": "./front-end",
      "apiLocation": "./api"
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can deploy your application by running the following steps:

1. If your front-end application requires a build step, run the build step (e.g. `npm run build`) or refer to your application build instructions.

2. Deploy your app:

```bash
swa deploy
```

If you have multiple configuration entries, you can provide the entry ID to specify which one to use:

```bash
swa deploy otherapp
```

## Use a runtime configuration file (staticwebapp.config.json)

Azure Static Web Apps can be configured with an optional `staticwebapp.config.json` file. For more information, see [Configure Static Web Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/configuration).

If you are serving static files from a folder, the CLI will search this folder for `staticwebapp.config.json`.

```bash
# this assumes that ./my-dist or its subfolders contains a staticwebapp.config.json file
swa start ./my-dist
```

If you are using a front-end dev server, the CLI will search the current directory for `staticwebapp.config.json`.

```bash
# current working directory is searched for staticwebapp.config.json
swa start http://localhost:3000
```

To control where the CLI searches for `staticwebapp.config.json`, use `--swa-config-location`.

```bash
# static files
swa start ./my-dist --swa-config-location ./my-app-source

# front-end dev server
swa start http://localhost:3000 --swa-config-location ./my-app-source
```

## CLI options

### `swa deploy` options

If you need to override the default values for the `swa deploy` subcommand, you can provide the following options:

| Option               | Description                                                    | Default | Example                         |

| `--dry-run`          | Simulate a deploy process without actually running it          | `false` | `--dry-run` or `--dry-run=true` |

<a id="swa-cli.config.json"></a>

## The CLI `swa-cli.config.json` configuration file

The CLI can also load options from a `swa-cli.config.json` file:

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "app": {
      "context": "http://localhost:3000",
      "apiLocation": "api",
      "run": "npm run start",
      "swaConfigLocation": "./my-app-source"
    }
  }
}
```

If only a single configuration is present in the `swa-cli.config.json` file, running `swa start` will use it by default. If options are loaded from a config file, no options passed in via command line will be respected. For example `swa start app --ssl=true`. The `--ssl=true` option will not be picked up by the CLI.

### Example

We can simplify these commands by putting the options into a config file:

```bash
# static configuration
swa start ./my-dist --swa-config-location ./my-app-source

# devserver configuration
swa start http://localhost:3000 --swa-config-location ./my-app-source
```

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "static": {
      "context": "./my-dist",
      "swaConfigLocation": "./my-app-source"
    },
    "devserver": {
      "context": "http://localhost:3000",
      "swaConfigLocation": "./my-app-source"
    }
  }
}
```

These configurations can be run with `swa start static` and `swa start devserver`.

### Validation

You can validate your `swa-cli.config.json` with a JSON Schema like so:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli/main/schema/swa-cli.config.schema.json",
  "configurations": {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Local authentication & authorization emulation

The CLI allows to mock and read authentication and authorization credentials.

### Mocking credentials

When requesting the Static Web Apps login endpoints (`http://localhost:4280/.auth/login/<PROVIDER_NAME>`), you have access to a local authentication UI. This interface is served locally from the emulator and allows you to set fake user information for the current user from the provider supplied.

### Reading credentials

The front-end application can request the `http://localhost:4280/.auth/me` endpoint and a `clientPrincipal` containing the fake information will be returned by the authentication API.

Here is an example:

```json
{
  "clientPrincipal": {
    "identityProvider": "twitter",
    "userId": "<USER-UUID>",
    "userDetails": "<USER_NAME>",
    "userRoles": ["anonymous", "authenticated"],
    "claims": [
      {
        "typ": "name",
        "val": "Azure Static Web Apps"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The API functions can access user information using the `x-ms-client-principal` header.

See [Accessing user information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/user-information) documentation for more details.

## High-level architecture

![swa cli architecture](./docs/swa-cli-architecture.png)

The SWA CLI is built on top of the following components:

- A **Reverse Proxy** is the heart of the SWA CLI; it's the piece that forwards all HTTP requests to the appropriate components:
  - `/.auth/**` requests are forwarded to the Auth emulator server.
  - `/api/**` requests are forwarded to the localhost API function (if available).
  - `/**` all other requests are forwarded to the static assets server (serving the front-end app).
- The **Auth emulator server** emulates the whole authentication flow.
- The **Static content server** serves the local app static content.
- The **Serverless API server** is served by Azure Functions Core Tools.
